    training_step

    starts by sampling a batch of experiences, then uses the DQN
    to predict the Q-Value for each possible action in each experiences
    next state.
    Assuming the agent with play optimally, we only keep the maximum Q-Value
    for each next state.
    Next, use the Target Q-Value function to compute the target Q-Value
    for each experiences state-action pair.

    Next, use the DQN to compute the Q-Value for each experienced state-action pair.
    This results in the DQN outputting the Q-Values for the other possible actions,
    not just for the action that was chosen by the agent. Thus, we need to mask out
    all of the Q-Values that we don't need. The tf.one_hot() function makes it easy
    to convert an array of action indices into such a mask.

    Next, we compute the lost: it is the mean squared error between the target and
    predicted Q-Values for the experienced state-action pairs.

    Finally, we perform a Gradient Descent step to minimize the loss with regard to
    the model's trainable variables.
